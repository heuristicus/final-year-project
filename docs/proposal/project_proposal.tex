\subsubsection*{Hardware \& software}

It is intended that the C programming language be used as the main language for the project, but this is yet to be decided. Other languages in consideration include Haskell, C++ and Python. If the need arises, Matlab may also be used, but it would be preferential to complete the project without its use. There will likely be no hardware requirements for this project other than a system which can run the finished code.
