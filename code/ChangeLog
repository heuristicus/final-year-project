	* estimators: Added a helper function to the estimators so that you do not
	have to call them with all the parameters specified if it is not necessary.
	You can now pass in a parameter list containing the relevant parameters,
	which will be extracted and passed into the function.

	* tests/Makefile.am: Tests can now be compiled using `make check`

	* tests/check_estimator.c: Added a basic test for estimator.c

	* tests/testmain.c: Added estimator test suite.

	* AUTHORS: Added name

	* ChangeLog: Put some actual stuff in it.

	* NEWS: Very brief information about releases.

	* README: Added basic information.
