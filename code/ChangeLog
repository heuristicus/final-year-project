	* file_util.c: Wondering whether to allow parameters without
	values specified. Makes having to specify loads of parameters
	in the experiment paramfile unnecessary if you just want to run
	experiments on one part of the system.

	* experimenter.c: Function to parse parameters from a string of
	comma separated values. If the string contains a range indicator
	(...), then it will revert to the function to calculate the range.
	Experimenter structure changed. Requires parameters to be defined
	for all the parts of the system you want to experiment with. Checks
	whether these parameters exist in the paramfile. Still a work in
	progress.

	* general_util.c: Function to check whether parameters in a string
	array are present in a paramlist.

	* general_util.c: Modified split_string function and its tests.

	* experimenter.c: Completed range parsing functions, with tests.
	Experimenter now takes two parameter files to read - one to read
	default parameters, and one for its own use. Checks that some required
	parameters are present.

	* exp_param.txt: Added some parameters that make sense to use.

	* check_file_util.c: Test for create file function.

	* file_util.c: Added function for creating files within directories.
	Fixed crash when parameter in paramfile does not have a value.

	* combinefunction.c: Basic error checking added.

	* tests: Tests for combining functions.

2013-01-26  Michal Staniaszek  <mxs968@cs.bham.ac.uk>

	* file_util.h: Function for writing one of the new structs to file.

	* launcher.c: multi-estimate data should go to specified output file.

	* general_util.c: Parameter for step used when going through data added

	* general_util.h: Added some structs to make array length storage easier.

	* combinefunction.c: Function used to combine functions now works as it should,
	returning an array containing data to use.

2013-01-23  Michal Staniaszek  <mxs968@cs.bham.ac.uk>

	* launcher.c: Updated to reflect changes to functions in combinefunction.c

	* combinefunction.c: Implemented a basic function combinator. Current implementation
	is rough and outputs to a file specified within the code.

2013-01-20  Michal Staniaszek  <mxs968@cs.bham.ac.uk>

	* launcher.c: Estimation of multiple streams at once by the launcher. Updated
	switches to allow for this. Some commenting and more checking for null values.

	* combinefunction.c: Function skeletons for combining functions.

	* makefile.am: Added new file and dependencies generated by it to launcher.

	* scripts: Removed unused plotting scripts. Obsoleted by plotmaster.

	* estimators: All now return an est_arr rather than some returning est_data.
	Easier to integrate with the launcher and other parts of the system.

	* memory: Fixed some leaks caused by swath of changes, and some old ones.

2013-01-19  Michal Staniaszek  <mxs968@cs.bham.ac.uk>

	* headers: Moved headers around in some files in src. Launcher strings
	moved into header file.

	* src/makefile.am: No longer includes muparser. Correctly added by
	configure.ac.

	* configure.ac: Checks for correct version of muparser.

	* plotmaster.sh: Plots data from the new plot

	* plots: Gnuplot code for plotting two estimates added


2013-01-13  Michal Staniaszek  <mxs968@cs.bham.ac.uk>

	* paramlist.c: Added functions for setting the value of parameters in the list.

	* file_util.c: Modified file generator to take parameters.

	* generator.c: Added helper function to extract parameters from a parameter
	file.

	* estimator_piecewise.c: Fixed bug with estimation data from the first
	subinterval not being output to file.

	* defparams.h: New header file containing default parameters for estimators
	and generator.

	* general_util.c: Added a function for generating a default parameter file,
	moved in function for checking parameters in a list.

2013-01-11  Michal Staniaszek  <mxs968@cs.bham.ac.uk>

	* estimator_piecewise.c: Removed preprocessor variables and modified functions
	to take additional parameters instead.

	* estimators: Added a helper function to the estimators so that you do not
	have to call them with all the parameters specified if it is not necessary.
	You can now pass in a parameter list containing the relevant parameters,
	which will be extracted and passed into the function.

	* tests/Makefile.am: Tests can now be compiled using `make check`

	* tests/check_estimator.c: Added a basic test for estimator.c

	* tests/testmain.c: Added estimator test suite.

	* AUTHORS: Added name

	* ChangeLog: Put some actual stuff in it.

	* NEWS: Very brief information about releases.

	* README: Added basic information.
