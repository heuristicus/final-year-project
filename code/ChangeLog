2013-01-30  Michal Staniaszek  <mxs968@cs.bham.ac.uk>

	* check_math_util.c: tests for the new functions

	* math_util.c: Function for generating a vector initialised with the same
	values, finding the minimum value in an array, adding a constant to an array.

	* launcher.c: Can generate gaussians from the launcher into output files.

	* generator.c: Generation functions for gaussians. Output data to files.

	* general_util.c: Parameters for gaussians added to default file generation.

	* file_util.c: Gauss transform output can be shifted along the y axis.

2013-01-27  Michal Staniaszek  <mxs968@cs.bham.ac.uk>

	* math_util.c: Error checking on parameters for some gaussian functions

	* check_math_util.c: Added tests for gaussian-related code

2013-01-26  Michal Staniaszek  <mxs968@cs.bham.ac.uk>

	* GMP: Removed use of GMP in math library - necessary functionality
	available in GSL.

	* estimator_piecewise.c: Replaced custom probability mass function with
	the function from the GSL.

	* math_util.h: Fixed bug in gaussian transform calculation, split some
	functions to get more control over what goes on.

	* file_util.h: Added functions for outputting gaussians and discrete
	Gaussian transforms to file. Moved includes into header file.

2013-01-25  Michal Staniaszek  <mxs968@cs.bham.ac.uk>

	* generator.c: Changed random number function usage to echo below
	changes.

	* configure.ac: Added checks for GSL library

	* math_util.c: Switched to using GSL to generate random numbers.
	Implemented discrete Gaussian transform with some structs to store
	Gaussians in a clean way. Various functions for initialising vectors
	of gaussians.


2013-01-23  Michal Staniaszek  <mxs968@cs.bham.ac.uk>

	* launcher.c: Updated to reflect changes to functions in combinefunction.c

	* combinefunction.c: Implemented a basic function combinator. Current implementation
	is rough and outputs to a file specified within the code.

2013-01-20  Michal Staniaszek  <mxs968@cs.bham.ac.uk>

	* launcher.c: Estimation of multiple streams at once by the launcher. Updated
	switches to allow for this. Some commenting and more checking for null values.

	* combinefunction.c: Function skeletons for combining functions.

	* makefile.am: Added new file and dependencies generated by it to launcher.

	* scripts: Removed unused plotting scripts. Obsoleted by plotmaster.

	* estimators: All now return an est_arr rather than some returning est_data.
	Easier to integrate with the launcher and other parts of the system.

	* memory: Fixed some leaks caused by swath of changes, and some old ones.

2013-01-19  Michal Staniaszek  <mxs968@cs.bham.ac.uk>

	* headers: Moved headers around in some files in src. Launcher strings
	moved into header file.

	* src/makefile.am: No longer includes muparser. Correctly added by
	configure.ac.

	* configure.ac: Checks for correct version of muparser.

	* plotmaster.sh: Plots data from the new plot

	* plots: Gnuplot code for plotting two estimates added


2013-01-13  Michal Staniaszek  <mxs968@cs.bham.ac.uk>

	* estimator_piecewise.c: Fixed bug with estimation data from the first
	subinterval not being output to file. Minimum length of interval now in
	place for piecewise estimate. Affects the baseline estimator as well.

	* defparams.h: New header file containing default parameters for estimators
	and generator.

	* general_util.c: Added a function for generating a default parameter file.

2013-01-11  Michal Staniaszek  <mxs968@cs.bham.ac.uk>

	* estimator_piecewise.c: Removed preprocessor variables and modified functions
	to take additional parameters instead.

	* estimators: Added a helper function to the estimators so that you do not
	have to call them with all the parameters specified if it is not necessary.
	You can now pass in a parameter list containing the relevant parameters,
	which will be extracted and passed into the function.

	* tests/Makefile.am: Tests can now be compiled using `make check`

	* tests/check_estimator.c: Added a basic test for estimator.c

	* tests/testmain.c: Added estimator test suite.

	* AUTHORS: Added name

	* ChangeLog: Put some actual stuff in it.

	* NEWS: Very brief information about releases.

	* README: Added basic information.
