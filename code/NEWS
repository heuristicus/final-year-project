Alpha 0.6: (19/02/13)

+ Estimating the delay between two streams is now possible. Two methods are
  available; area and pmf. The area computation works by calculating the
  area between the curves of two functions and picking the time delay
  which minimises this area. The pmf method uses the sum of probability
  mass functions at points on the function estimates of both streams compared
  to the bin counts for the relevant interval. The delay chosen is the one which
  maximises the sum. The use of a hierarchical method which does two passes over
  the data, initially with a coarse pass, and following with a finer pass over
  a smaller part of the data based on the initial estimate.

+ Data output improved - files now have names which should indicate the data
  that they contain more clearly. The -t switch can be used to output data to
  various levels of granularity. Running launcher -h gives more information about
  what sort of data each subsystem produces.

Alpha 0.5: (04/02/13)

+ Random functions can be generated. These functions are constructed by summing
  sets of weighted gaussians. Use
  `launcher -g params.txt -r`
  to generate a random function in its raw form, or 
  `launcher -g params.txt -r -t 2`
  to output the sum of the gaussians in the interval, and the value of each gaussian
  used to construct the function.
+ Event streams can be generated from these random functions with
  `launcher -g params.txt -f rand`
  To use this it is necessary to first generate gaussians in their raw form using
  `launcher -g params.txt -r`
+ A basic kernel density estimator is avaliable. Use
  `launcher -e params.txt -a gauss`
  for an estimate. The normalisation on estimates is not correctly applied in this
  build.
+ The parameter file now has additional parameters to configure the generation of
  gaussians. Generate a default file with
  `launcher -d params.txt`
+ The GMP library is no longer used. The functionality that required it is now
  provided by the GNU Scientific Library (GSL)

Alpha 0.4.1: (27/01/13)

+ Hotfix for missing header file

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha 0.4: (27/01/13)

+ Multiple function estimates can be combined to make a single estimate. Try
  running 
  `launcher -g params.txt -n 2`
  `launcher -e params.txt -a base -l -n 2 -o multitest.txt`
  and plotting the output.
+ Parameter files can be automatically generated using `launcher -d filename`

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha 0.3: (11/01/13)

+ Moved project to autotools for extra portability and easier compilation.
+ Launcher can be used to run generator and estimators. Try src/launcher -h
  for more information.
+ Basic baseline estimator added.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha 0.2: (29/11/12)

+ Piecewise estimator added to usable estimators.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha 0.1: (04/11/12)

+ First release.
