######### settings
# If you want to run the experiments with parameters co-varying, set this
# to no. If you are working on the parameters a 1,2,3 and b 1,2,3, then
# running them with parameters co-varying will get you results for
# permutations of the parameters. If the experiment priority is a,b then
# you will get results with parameter settings like a1b1, a1b2, a1b3, a2b1,
# a2b2, and so on, for all parameter combinations. This might take a very long
# time if you have a lot of parameters and values.
run_separately no

# Here, you can specify the names for experiments that you want to run. Parameters
# to test can be added to these experiments by adding a [name]_params parameter
# to this file. The experiments can be run by defining a test_[name] parameter
# here and setting its value to yes.
